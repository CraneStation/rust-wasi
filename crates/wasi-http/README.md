This crate contains API bindings for the [HTTP proposal](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-http) of
[WASI](https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI).

It will have a basic implementation and conversion to
non-opinionated types like from/to the 
[http crate](https://crates.io/crates/http) for the 
[`wasi:http/proxy` world](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-http/blob/main/wit/proxy.wit).
